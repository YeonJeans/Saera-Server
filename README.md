Saera is providing educational solutions based on the app's high accessibility to help North Koreans make a smooth transition to South Korea.

## ‚ùóÔ∏è  Introduction
North and South Korea use the same writing system and have similar grammar, but they have developed linguistic differences over the years due to their different environments and societies where they lived for many years after the division. For North Koreans adjusting to life in South Korea, pronunciation and accent can be some of the most challenging differences, leading to discrimination. To bridge this gap, we created SAERA, an app that enables users to learn pronunciation and accent. In pronunciation learning, we provide word examples with standard pronunciation and tips on how to pronounce words and what to pay attention to when pronouncing words based on the differences between South and North Korean. For intonation learning, SAERA presents the target intonation and voice audibly and visually through a Korean TTS and pitch graph generation model. It also visualizes the user's recorded voice in a graph and evaluates it with a rating for each graph. <br/>

With SAERA, we hope North Korean defectors can quickly learn the South Korean language system and overcome language barriers to settle into South Korean society stably.
